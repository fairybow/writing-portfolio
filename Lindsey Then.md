# Lindsey Then

> Published November 2017 in *Delmarva Review, vol. 10*

And Lindsey and I drove for a few hours or so looking at houses for fun. It was nice and warm in the car, all up and down us, for sure. The road curved and cut forward into the middles of scatter towns and neighborhoods. There was stratus hatchwork in the sky, like skated-on ice, under one bold little heartbreaker of a jet trail, and we kept the radio off and the windows open.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lindsey’d been quieter lately, and by then it’d started to grate on me, but like still it was one of those nice kind of days.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, right next to me, real neat televangelist teeth, olivine eyes, tall and thin limbs, cider color skin, bright and big as a minute, was Lindsey. She’d take her eyes off the road to look at me when I’d talk to her, and it’d scare us both a little when she’d swerve on accident. So I wouldn’t talk. Then I’d sink my hands, back to back, between my thighs, and moon. Sigh once or twice, and rest my head to the side, on the door and the warm window weather stripping, so I could be a little bit outside and have a little wind, and I’d think, you know, look at me or something again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed this house that was like canary yellow. Gables all over the place and the sprinkler on, two garage doors with lanterns over top, and this well-loved little garden on the lawn, and Oh, Linz, I said, I’m not ready for that kind of commitment. That’s a little too Gee Whiz, don’t you think?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she went with it, like Oh, Jo. Joanne, she said, I can’t commit to anything in this economic climate, let alone two point five kids and a white picket fence. Besides, what kind of neighborhood is this? I just saw a paperboy steal a pie off that windowsill.

We were both young, just nineteen and twenty three, four years ago, and this was all about five months after she’d kissed me, skinny hands on my cheeks, squeezing, because she’d had this dream: where the enormous suggestion of a face, embedded like right in her shower floor, spoke in her mother’s voice, something that she couldn’t remember at all, and then its mouth opened, and then it mawed, cracking like wood, and then it roared like brass, and her bones rang, and her veins all slithered to the bottom of her. Then the maw swallowed, first, the tiling. Then the water. And then her body and the walls, and then somehow I was there, but I didn’t look like me, and the next morning she said, right by the dumpster at work: Jo, I just have to know. And so she kissed me, like she said it’d happened in the dream, like we would die if we didn’t, and then soon we started seeing each other more.

So, though we weren’t far from anything familiar just yet, we stopped to fill up. Partly because the place was real quaint: the last thing remaining around there, you’d think, from like nineteen thirty eight: a small, country place, alcoved all lovely, squished right up against the hill next to the road. And with two of those fiftiesy gas pumps. You know the ones, I hope: number tickers, green and white, and like a Sinclair Dino light on top, and Lindsey paid the old man at the till in change, and he dropped the coins into the thing and slammed it shut and said, You ladies have fun, okay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sat with these sandwiches at this round umbrella-table off by the trash can, ice bins and propane tanks, and we were across from one another but mostly always looking over, instead, to the road and the other side of it. She seemed pretty taken with her sandwich, though she never did like lettuce, so she picked it off and threw it over her head, and I said, Hey, how’re you? And she said, mouth full, Jo, I don’t know, what about you?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I said, I didn’t know, too, and I asked her if her sandwich was good, and she said, It is. You?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine, too, for sure, I said. And she was like, You say that now like I do.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do? I said, and she said, Yeah, you do.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple pulled up to fill up like us, and the girl had on this copperish dress, and he had this bashful looking black suit, a little too loose, with a suit-flower pinned on. He opened the door for his little date and let her out, and I thought I’d ask Lindsey if she thought they loved one another, young as they were, and how, but I asked her instead where she thought they were going, and she sort of said, Oh, hell, I don’t know? Prom, I guess?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it that time already? I said. And she said, It must be, and so I was like, Completely slipped my mind. Let’s dance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lindsey laughed, and so we left.

The road out of this one neighborhood block was taking us up a hill toward a ridge, and right at either side of the road ahead, it got really serious, like with trees and rocks and shoots or whatever. The works. The road snaked, and a slight ways up the hill it elbow curved around this little house, like: how on earth has nobody lost control of their car and taken this place, and themselves, out of the picture for good? It wasn’t old, but made to look that way: timber framed, wood everything except spaces between, and oh, the brick chimney, which had little half shell pasta smoke puffs rolling out and in on themselves, disappearing up. A small stone fence around this blunt edged wedge of a yard, a wood driveway gate and ivy webbed all over everything. Real Shakespeare. And I’d bet for sure in the quiet winter you’d get a real good first snow sizzle because of the dead leaves everywhere.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honey, are the mince pies ready? I asked.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she was like, I’m sorry, love. I just haven’t had the time to mince. The baby’s died again, and the cat’s left handed, so I’ve had to burn it to death.

<p align="center">*</p>

So like I remember the houses getting bigger and nicer, for the most part, the farther up we got on the ridge, once we broke through the trees, and we’d got real high up, with yards on either side that carried on out for as long as they could before they’d drop-make the valleys to the left and right of us. This one? It was real vertical, for sure, and the bottom of it, the skirting or whatever, was just like shipping pallets put together, painted white and prettied up, but with all that space in between, and we had no idea how the house, which was very dewy blue and tall, was even standing. The doors and windows had fat, white wood trim, and it was angular in the strangest places. Like any of the gabled dormers? They slanted up off the thing instead of straightways or down. It was real avant-garde, I think, and Lindsey cooed: Love, I’m late for the art installation, and I need you to watch Averly and Sebastian.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I said, Our well-mannered twins who call us by our first names?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll hurry back, as best I can, she said, (You know how Gregory loves to bitch).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I said, Let’s give each other wine-smelling goodbye kisses, but not on the lips.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we didn’t know how to joke about some houses. These lifeless, tall, fenced-off and stone ones, half circle drivewayed and fancy mailboxes. Real Elsinores, for sure, the owners must’ve thought. Fit for great Danes. Like Marmaduke, we joked. And it was getting real dark, and light across the horizon left the sky from like bright white to pink, purple to black.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed another place that sprawled, low on the hill, with a well-lit pool. Real character to it all. These stuccoed, desert color walls, a terracotta red roof, and big, big plants, and I said, Linz, I’m beat. Business at the office has sure made me tired. All those mergers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stocks, dear? she said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, heavens, the stocks. Time is money. We’re downsizing, too. Buy, sell. And she just said, Heavens, I’ll be right back. Let me get you San Pellegrino and crush up an Ambien for you to rail.

So but the houses got smaller, and it was a lot darker, and we were getting tired anyway and couldn’t hardly see one another. I think the jokes had lost their fun, so it was just this faint, motor noise and cicada song, the few oncoming cars, and quiet us. We turned around to go home in someone’s driveway, and the place was small, but still so busy. Upside down flowerpots, like little temples by hills of dirt. House vines, tangled wind chimes, bikes and branches, these old toys on lawn chairs and long grass patches, and clover. This red lawn mower. A blue tarp pooling greening water, covering whatever. All soon in like morning light, glimmer-splitting from behind the tree mesh behind all things there, touching over insects, dew pearls and a few cans of beer, sticking in eyelashes. All soon moving, all whispering, in wind. A rippling hush, nodding heads.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A screen door, a tiled square of floor, pairs of shoes, a coat rack, and flicks of black and leaf and sole patterns in faint lines on the tile. A television set on quiet in the back. A burning picture frame hearth, and drugstore wall art. All flicker lit. An empty glass bowl for mints on the table that the flickers flicker in. A chintz sofa from who knows when, and dust on the ceiling fans, and the same five magazines, dried tight, for fifteen years in a basket on the back of the can. A bed, impressed. Bowed and bent like a witness.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she said I know it’s my turn tonight, and I’ll have dinner ready soon, but let’s cook together instead, and when the weather’s better, let’s mow the lawn, and put on some tunes outside and maybe paint this place up nice, three coats, just so we can do it together more than once, and we can do whatever we want with the place, a little space is a lot, and I want to read with you, a book I just bought, something good, from start to finish, something new, and I want to do it all together, okay, I want to do it all together with you, okay?, and sometimes these things take a little longer than we thought, and please read slow, love, my ears are old, and my eyes are shot, and I hope it’s not too late before we’re done, and I know I’m quiet but I’m having fun, and what am I talking about anyway. It’s Saturday today, and we don’t have anywhere to be tomorrow.

So like I’ll tell you I really remember saying goodbye, and you always say forever, forgetting about cancer and general death or whatever, or at least I do, because I’m not realistic, and none of it ever seems to make much sense at the time, or after it, and I figured we’d pass back by that gas station. And wasn’t it all just beginning? And I wondered if it’d be open tomorrow, like with church or whatever, and I thought I might just go then and sit down for a little while with a soda in a glass bottle, just by myself, to watch people go out and come in, and think about all of them, and just with Lindsey then like laser focused on the road home and bed and ahead of us, I was growing real quickly curious about the dust and muck and bobby pins and crumbs that’d collected since forever in the sun faded plastic and pleather center console between us, and she would drop me off, I thought, and we’d kiss bye, and for sure do it all again later, but Lindsey lives in Arizona now, and now she’s got a baby, and he really is the most gorgeous kid.

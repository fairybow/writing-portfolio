Clean, safe drinking water is a fundamental necessity, yet its availability is often taken for granted. However, recent data underscores a sobering reality in the United States: the safety of our drinking water may not be as guaranteed as we once believed.

In August 2017, a USA Today headline caused nationwide concern: "63 Million Americans Exposed to Unsafe Drinking Water." The article revealed that nearly 20% of Americans, from the rural expanses of California to the bustling streets of New York City, had been "exposed to potentially unsafe water more than once in the past decade." This news was a wake-up call, leading to a deeper look into the [safety of drinking water in the U.S.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/08/14/63-million-americans-exposed-unsafe-drinking-water/564278001/)

## Which Countries Excel In Tap Water Safety? <a id="1"></a>

To gain a broader perspective on this issue, we turn to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), a comprehensive report compiled by environmental researchers from Yale and Columbia University, and supported by the World Economic Forum. This index evaluates 180 countries using 24 performance indicators across ten categories, including drinking water safety.

The EPI uses a metric called "unsafe drinking water." It’s calculated based on the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) lost per 100,000 people because of unsafe drinking water. A perfect score of 100 signifies a country has one of the lowest DALY rates in the world (≤5th-percentile), while a score of 0 indicates a high DALY rate (≥95th-percentile). The data for this indicator is sourced from the Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation’s (IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. 

In the 2020 EPI, the U.S. ranked 23rd in the "Drinking Water" category with a score of 89.2. In the 2022 EPI, the U.S. kept its 23rd position, but its score slightly increased to 89.3.

This places the United States just shy of the top ten countries for safe drinking water according to the EPI. The countries that made it to the top ten in 2022, all with a perfect score of 100, include Austria, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

## Deciphering the U.S. Drinking Water Infrastructure Dilemma <a id="2"></a>

Why doesn't the U.S. achieve a perfect score for drinking water safety? The answer lies beneath our feet, in the aging water infrastructure that delivers water to American homes. This deteriorating system presents a significant challenge to maintaining water safety.

In 2016, Deloitte, a renowned consulting firm, published an article titled "The Aging Water Infrastructure: Out of Sight, Out of Mind?" This piece referenced a report from the American Water Works Association, which provided a startling insight. It revealed that "cast-iron pipes laid in the late 1800s have an average lifespan of 120 years; pipes laid in the 1920s, using different manufacturing techniques, have a lifespan of 100 years, and pipes laid during the post-WWII economic boom are expected to last about 75 years." This suggests that the U.S. urgently needs to overhaul and upgrade its water infrastructure. Until this pressing issue is addressed, we risk [exposing our citizens to water contamination](https://cowaymega.com/blogs/blog/four-common-contaminants-in-your-drinking-water).

## The Aging Water Infrastructure In America <a id="3"></a>

America's water infrastructure is in a state of crisis. Pipes, water treatment plants, and distribution systems that have served us for decades are struggling to meet modern standards. As a result, contaminants can more easily infiltrate our drinking water, posing a threat to public health. This crisis warrants serious attention.

Aging water infrastructure is a nationwide issue, affecting communities all over the country. In some areas, lead contamination incidents linked to old infrastructure have increased public concern and awareness. It’s clear that we need to address this issue on a national level. Finding a solution is crucial for the safety of our drinking water.

## The Basics of Embedded Finance

Embedded finance is quickly becoming a major innovation in the financial services industry. This new model seamlessly integrates financial products and services into non-financial platforms and apps. For consumers, it delivers a more convenient, [personalized experience](https://www.bytandym.com/articles/increase-aov-and-repeat-purchases) by making financing or banking available in the moment, right within apps they already use and love.

One major advantage of embedded finance is that it allows non-financial companies to offer financial services without having to become licensed financial institutions themselves. For example, a retailer could enable customers to apply for financing for purchases directly on their website via embedded lending. This is possible through technology like APIs and SDKs that allow easy integration of financial services into existing business platforms.

Embedded finance also expands access to financial products. Customers can discover and utilize services where and when they need them most, like insurance within a transportation app or BNPL financing at checkout. This creates a frictionless experience that could incentivize more consumers to use these kinds of services.

For companies, embedded finance presents new revenue opportunities and the ability to deliver more value to customers. It also enables more personalized, data-driven financial offerings. For example, a mobile banking app could offer customized investment recommendations based on a user's spending insights.

As open banking regulations evolve and more fintech startups emerge offering embeddable financial APIs, embedded finance will likely continue its rapid growth. This could forever change how consumers experience and manage their financial lives.

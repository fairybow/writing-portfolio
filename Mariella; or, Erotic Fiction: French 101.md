> *Et Cetera, 2012*

I walked through the door and into the smoky *café*. The smell that hung in the air was familiar and strong, yet something about it was new—unplaceable; combined with the coffee, smoke and the fresh night air, the scent seemed to paint a picture in my mind: a map, unseen and beckoning me along its marked path—a path that I knew would lead me to the source of that wonderful disturbance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there she stood against the bar. The purple light gave her an otherworldly glow. She noticed me noticing her, and I noticed that she had noticed the notice so I made note in my notepad to never enact a noticeable notice unless the noticed you noticed noticed you first. She smiled. I put my notepad in my suit jacket and took a spot beside her. I made a complicated hand gesture to the bartender. He understood perfectly. *Two drinks*, I signaled, *and the lady will have a diet*.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled again and laughed affectionately. I saw her drool only slightly. “*Bonjour*,” she said, biting her lip and extending her delicate, gloved hand. I took it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“*Bonjour mademoiselle*,” I replied, pocketing the hand in my suit jacket. I watched her as she struggled to open the bottle of soda, pinning it against the bar with her body and working at the lid, and, before I knew it, I was lost again in those big, blue eyes. I could tell she felt a little self-conscious about them. They were entirely blue and everyone around us had been staring. I leaned in, grabbing the bottle, placed my lips to her ear and whispered gently: “*Est-ce que tu aimes ma bicyclette? Je conduis ma bicyclette à la bibliothèque*.” She smiled and allowed me to take the bottle. I opened it and drank it completely in under twelve seconds—a new record. She seemed impressed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“*Oui, j'aime ta bicyclette*,” she said as she ran her arm-thing down the sleeve of my jacket, “*J'habite à Paris avec ma sœur*.” She stopped at my hand. “*D'où est-ce que tu viens*?”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“*Je viens de* Nova Scotia *et j'ai trois chattes noires*.” I knew she wanted me, and, by the alluring smile on her face, I knew that she knew that I knew that she wanted me. I smiled back. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“*J'adore chats noirs*,” she said in coy misunderstanding. I thought I had made myself clear—my cats were female. Still, she was intoxicating, and I found that I couldn't help myself—I was at the mercy of her voice. I leaned in even closer, having been at about a sixty-degree angle, and mere inches away from her face this whole time. Now it was more like forty-five. We hesitated, savoring the sweet moment. I could taste her breath in my mouth, and I knew that, shortly, it would go back into hers with my expiration and then back and forth a couple more times. The same air. I could feel my heart racing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“*Puis-je utiliser les toilettes, professeur*?” I uttered between breaths before kissing her. At last! This was the moment I had been longing for. From the instant I saw her, I knew I wanted desperately for our faces to mash together. She broke free and moaned, pulling me closer. As I kissed her neck she pleaded to me, “*J'ai une le car verte dans mon garage*!” Her breathing grew quicker and heavier as she began to grind into me. It was clearly beginning to affect her descriptive agreement. I turned and pinned her to the bar, answering her plea. Her back bent sharply on the edge, and her spine popped. It seemed unpleasant.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“*Je mange des sandwiches*! *Je mange des sandwiches*!” she cried out. I threw her completely across the room and then sprinted over and threw her back to the place she had been before. Then I sat her on the bar and began to undress her.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“*Est-ce que tu étudies en classe*?”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“*Oui, j'étudie en classe*!” she cried once more, “*Je n'aime pas les mathématiques*!” I climbed atop the bar and began pouring top-shelf liquor on her naked body as she ripped pieces of my hair out. And then, suddenly, our eyes met. Our animalistic passions subsided and she lifted her head up to meet mine. We held each other for a moment. I knew I would never see her again after tonight and something inside of her, perhaps her brain, must have told her the same thing. She began to cry.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I held her closer. “*Je n'aime pas les mathématiques aussi. Est-ce que tu veux parler avec moi*?” I whispered. She laughed weakly and smiled that beautiful, tender smile.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just as swiftly as it had begun, it was over. She put her tattered and stretched clothes back on and turned to me. I reached into my suit jacket and gave back her hand. She looked deeply into my eyes, kissing me one last time. For five, maybe six minutes we kissed, eyes completely open. And then, just like that, she left. As the people in the *café* looked on in astonishment and the bartender cleared out the broken glass with a vacuum cleaner, I couldn't help but think about her. In a way, I loved her more than I'll ever love any woman, and I missed her even then, as she walked away and out the door and into her car and onto the highway. I wouldn't have—couldn't have—had it any other way. Two star-crossed lovers, fated only to briefly pass in the night, were we. I'll never look back and neither will she. I'll never forget the last thing she said to me, just before she left: “*Je veux parler avec toi. Je suis français*.”
